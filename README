This repository contains MATLAB code that was used in the following paper:

  "Zero-forcing methods for downlink spatial multiplexing in multiuser MIMO
  channels", Quentin H. Spencer, A. Lee Swindlehurst and Martin Haardt, IEEE
  Transactions on Signal Processing, Feb. 2004, pp. 461-471.

I get periodic requests for the code used to generate the results in the
article, so I am putting this here. Note that the code was mostly written
in 2002 or earlier. Some of the code depends functions I had written at the
time that did not exist in MATLAB at the time (i.e. cdf, ccdf, random). I
have attempted to include my versions of these functions so that all of the
code runs correctly, because the functions now present in MATLAB may not
do exactly the same thing or have the same interface.
